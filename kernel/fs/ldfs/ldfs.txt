    Legacy Disk File System
===============================

    Legacy Disk File System or LDFS was
    a short lived file system used in OS/1
    before BBFS. It doesn't recognize files
    instead it just jumps to 0x0000:0x7e00
    of a disk in the drive A/B.

    Only here for backward compatibility
