    Pinboard Environment
============================

    Pinboard Environment or just Pinb for
    short is a simple "graphical" environment
    written for OS/1 (but it can be used for
    other operating systems).

    It was first introduced in OS/1 3.0.0 and
    since than has been an integral part of
    OS/1, making up about 64.69% of its total
    code.

    Pinb doesn't offer much. Just a simple
    text editor, a paint program, and a
    shortcut to the shell.
