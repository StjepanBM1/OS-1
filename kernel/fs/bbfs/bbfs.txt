    Bad Block File System
=============================

        Bad Block File System or BBFS for short
    is a very bad file system used in OS/1.
        
        It uses 4KiB blocks for data storage
    with 12-bytes for the name storage of blocks.
    as of OS/1 5.3.0 there is only read support
    of BBFS parameters. Expect the write support
    in the next few releases.
